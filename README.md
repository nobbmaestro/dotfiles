# Nobbmaestro's dotfiles

Dotfiles and automations that should make my life easier (or rather harder?).

- [Amethyst](https://github.com/ianyh/Amethyst) Automatic tiling window manager for MacOS.
- [Homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew) The Missing Package Manager for MacOS (or Linux).
- [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) A Modern, ground up rewrite of Vim.
- [Oh-My-Zsh](https://www.zsh.org) Oh My Zsh is an open source, community-driven framework for managing your zsh configuration.
- [PowerLevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) A zsh theme that emphasizes speed, flexibility and an out-of-box experience.
- [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) Create, split, save, move terminal tabs easily all within one window.
- [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org) Zsh is a shell designed for interactive use, although it is also a powerful scripting language.

## Getting started

Check out [install.sh](install.sh). You may either run `./install.sh all` or pick whatever you find interesting.

The script won't run anything unless argument is passed. Once you pass decired argument, the `install.sh` will override your local dotfiles.
Therefore, you may consider running `./install backup` prior to installment, which in turn shall create a copy of all conflicting dotfiles at `~/dotfiles-backup/`.

The script will:

- install Homebrew & dependencies,
- install Xcode and CLI components,
- setup symlinks for various configuration files, etc.

## Final words

This very repository is primarily intended to be used on MacOS, hence heavy dependence on Homebrew. However, it shall work just fine on any Unix distro.
If not, please feel free to create an issue with the bug description.

Enjoy!
